        when language has a line by line execution then it is an interpreted language

        when language is compiled into exe file, and then runs it is compiled language

        JAVA is a hybrid language it compiles java file into bytecode(class file) and then
         can be used by java interpreter (JVM)

        This bytecode can be interpreted at any platform like window, linux, mac etc
         Hence java is platform independent (write once run Everywhere)
